# walkability
Walkable cities offer a multitude of benefits for both individuals and communities. By fostering a pedestrian-friendly environment, these cities contribute to various aspects of well-being, including physical and mental health, environmental sustainability, economic prosperity, social interaction, and safety. The emphasis on walkability enhances the overall quality of life for residents, creating a cohesive and thriving community.

walkability was created to help users navigate the stresses of moving to a new location. Users may enter the gps coordinates of a potential new apartment or home and will be delivered a walkability score to help them through their decision-making process!
